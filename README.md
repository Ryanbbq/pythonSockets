# pythonSockets
# A simple python server which accepts connections from two clients
## pip install socket

# Run the 'server.py' file first
-> Follow up by running the 'client.py' and 'client2.py'

# I used a simple Alice & Bob Method
## 'Server.py' sends messages to both clients
## 'Server.py' recieves messages from both clients
## 'Client(s).py' sends and recieves messages from 'Server.py'
